### About Me

ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Rave! Iâ€™m a 2nd-year IT student and aspiring developer, currently learning full-stack development with a focus on machine learning and AI, and I have a background in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React.js, Java, and Python, which has given me a solid foundation to start building projects and experimenting with different technologies; at the moment, Iâ€™m expanding my skills in Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB, aiming to become a full-stack developer capable of handling both the front-end and back-end of web applications, and Iâ€™m passionate about creating projects that combine creativity and functionality while exploring the potential of machine learning and AI to make a positive impact through technology.
